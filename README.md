# Real-Time Traffic Density Estimation

## 📌 Overview
This project provides a **real-time traffic density estimation** system using **YOLOv8** for vehicle detection and **OpenCV** for video frame processing. A **Django backend** is integrated to facilitate a user-friendly **web interface** that enables users to upload videos and visualize real-time traffic conditions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop an **automated** system for real-time traffic monitoring.
- Leverage **deep learning** with YOLOv8 for precise vehicle detection.
- Utilize **OpenCV** for efficient video processing.
- Implement a **Django-based web application** for user interaction.
- Enable **FFmpeg** for optimized video streaming.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **YOLOv8** - Object detection for real-time vehicle identification.
- **OpenCV** - Processing video frames efficiently.
- **Django** - Backend framework for system integration.
- **FFmpeg** - Video streaming optimization.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Real-time vehicle detection** from video streams.
- **Traffic density analysis** for urban congestion monitoring.
- **Web-based UI** for uploading and analyzing videos.
- **Scalable and efficient** processing with modern deep learning techniques.
